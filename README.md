📌 About This Repository
I am currently learning Python with a focus on its use in Data Science and Data Analysis.
This repository serves as a collection of my practice work, notes, and examples as I build my skills in this field.

Python is one of the most important languages for data-driven work. Through this journey, I am exploring:

🏗 Core Python concepts – to strengthen my programming foundation.

📊 Data Analysis – cleaning, processing, and working with datasets using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

📈 Data Visualization – representing insights using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🔬 Foundations of Data Science – preparing for topics like machine learning and statistical modeling.

This repo reflects my step-by-step learning process and will continue to grow as I advance further in Python for Data Science and Analytics.
